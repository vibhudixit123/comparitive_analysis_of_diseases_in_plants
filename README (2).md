# Crop Disease Detection using ResNet

This repository houses the code and documentation for a deep learning-based crop disease detection classifier. The model utilizes the ResNet (Residual Neural Network) architecture for robust feature extraction and deep learning capabilities, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy in plant diseases. The dataset, comprising over 70,000 images spanning 14 distinct crop types, is sourced from the Plant Village dataset. The ResNet model is chosen for its inherent ability to facilitate the training of deep neural networks, enabling the identification of intricate patterns within images for effective and timely disease identification in agricultural ecosystems.
